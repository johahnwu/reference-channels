      as the database 'sa' user and of the admin user created during installation. This password
      is encrypted with a static key, and is encrypted using a weak cipher (ECB). By default,

      the administrator has not changed the password for the initially created account since installation,

CVE-2015-3864,Name: Android Stagefright MP4 tx3g Integer Overflow,MSF Path:exploit/android/browser/stagefright_mp4_tx3g_64bit,Rank: Normal,8/13/2015,Type: exploit,"This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the Stagefright
        Library (libstagefright.so). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially
        crafted MP4 files. While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this
        particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser.

          Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MP4 file with two
        tx3g atoms that, when their sizes are summed, cause an integer overflow when
        processing the second atom. As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated
        with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow.

          This version of the exploit uses a two-stage information leak based on
        corrupting the MetaData that the browser reads from mediaserver. This method
        is based on a technique published in NorthBit's Metaphor paper. First,
        we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer
        located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's
        videoHeight. Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within
        the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration. This gives
        us a code address that we can use to determine the base address of
        libstagefright and construct a ROP chain dynamically.

        NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is
        constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call. To avoid
        this problem, the original exploit uses a kernel exploit payload that disables
        SELinux and spawns a shell as root. Work is underway to make the framework
        more amenable to these types of situations. Until that work is complete, this
        exploit will only yield a shell on devices without SELinux or with SELinux in
        permissive mode.","References: ['CVE-2015-3864', 'URL-https://blog.exodusintel.com/2015/08/13/stagefright-mission-accomplished/', 'URL-http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/09/stagefrightened.html', 'URL-https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorthBit/Public/master/NorthBit-Metaphor.pdf', 'URL-https://github.com/NorthBit/Metaphor', 'URL-http://drops.wooyun.org/papers/7558', 'URL-http://translate.wooyun.io/2015/08/08/Stagefright-Vulnerability-Disclosure.html', 'URL-https://www.nccgroup.trust/globalassets/our-research/uk/whitepapers/2016/01/libstagefright-exploit-notespdf/']"

        operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument
        without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233).

          The type confusion leads to the ability to allocate fake Javascript objects,
        as well as the ability to find the address in memory of a Javascript object.
        This allows us to construct a fake JSCell object that can be used to read
        and write arbitrary memory from Javascript.  The module then uses a ROP chain
        to write the first stage shellcode into executable memory within the Safari
        process and kick off its execution.

          The first stage maps the second stage macho (containing CVE-2017-13861) into

        1.3.0 of ProFTPD server. The vulnerability is within the ""sreplace"" function
        within the ""src/support.c"" file.

        The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been
        discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit
        this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug
        since then.

        Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the
        mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow
        via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'.

        We were unable to reach the ""sreplace"" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable
        version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them:

        1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace!
        2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via
          the ""pr_display_file"" function!
        3. stupid '.message' file display bug

        So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit.
        To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a
        writeable directory, then do ""CWD <writeable directory>"" to trigger the invocation
        of sreplace function.

        Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message'
        file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug.

        The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.","References: ['CVE-2006-5815', 'OSVDB-68985', 'BID-20992', 'URL-https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2006/Nov/94', 'URL-https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2006/Nov/538', 'URL-http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2858', 'URL-http://proftp.cvs.sourceforge.net/proftp/proftpd/src/main.c?view=diff&r1=text&tr1=1.292&r2=text&tr2=1.294&diff_format=h']"

        large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and
        execute arbitrary code.

        The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly
        transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec ""res"" in
        ""pr_cmd_read"").

        The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub
        to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload
        in and executes it.

        NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of
        ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection.

        Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt
        succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a
        default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite
        some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually
        guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability.

        The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness
        and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time.","References: ['CVE-2010-4221', 'OSVDB-68985', 'BID-44562']"

CVE-2015-5082,Name: Endian Firewall Proxy Password Change Command Injection,MSF Path:exploit/linux/http/efw_chpasswd_exec,Rank: Excellent,6/28/2015,Type: exploit,"This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in a
        web-accessible CGI script used to change passwords for locally-defined
        proxy user accounts. Valid credentials for such an account are
        required.

        Command execution will be in the context of the ""nobody"" account, but
        this account had broad sudo permissions, including to run the script
        /usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for the Linux
        root account on the system to the value specified by console input
        once it is executed).

        The password for the proxy user account specified will *not* be
        changed by the use of this module, as long as the target system is
        vulnerable to the exploit.

        Very early versions of Endian Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require
        HTTP basic auth credentials as well to exploit this vulnerability.
        Use the USERNAME and PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values
        if required.

        Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable code, but it appears to
        never be executed due to a bug in the vulnerable CGI script which also
        prevents normal use (http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002).

        Versions 2.3.x and 2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug
        (http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083).

        Tested successfully against the following versions of EFW Community:

        1.1 RC5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5.1, 2.5.2.

CVE-2010-2063,Name: Samba chain_reply Memory Corruption (Linux x86),MSF Path:exploit/linux/samba/chain_reply,Rank: Good,6/16/2010,Type: exploit,"This exploits a memory corruption vulnerability present in Samba versions
        prior to 3.3.13. When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate
        the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a
        number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory.
        Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will
        cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted.

        After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not
        exploitable. Since they use an ""InputBuffer"" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot
        cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the
        heap header of the ""InputBuffer"", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk
        to be processed again prior to process exit.

        In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a ""talloc
        chunk"" destructor function pointer.

        This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems
        that do not have the nx memory protection.

        NOTE: It is possible to make exploitation attempts indefinitely since Samba forks
        for user sessions in the default configuration.","References: ['CVE-2010-2063', 'OSVDB-65518', 'URL-http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=873']"

        version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the
        heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon.

        The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full
        prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function.
        In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message
        that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which
        is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header
        string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL
        FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated
        with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed.

        It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such
        as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers
        stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform
        specific, more complicated, and less reliable.

        This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not
        properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time
        between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited
        in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being
        addressed by downstream vendors.

        led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to

        Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing
        stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars
        about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string,

        stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x)
        will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to
        move the read pointer outside of the buffer.

        Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does
        not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value
        within the buffer.

          It was initially found in the wild in Japan, but other regions such as English,
          Chinese, Korean, etc, were targeted as well.

          The vulnerability is due to how the mshtml!CDoc::SetMouseCapture function handles a
          reference during an event. An attacker first can setup two elements, where the second
          is the child of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent
          element. The onlosecapture event seems to require two setCapture() calls to trigger,
          one for the parent element, one for the child. When the setCapture() call for the child
          element is called, it finally triggers the event, which allows the attacker to cause an
          arbitrary memory release using document.write(), which in particular frees up a 0x54-byte
          memory.  The exact size of this memory may differ based on the version of IE. After the
          free, an invalid reference will still be kept and pass on to more functions, eventuall
          this arrives in function MSHTML!CTreeNode::GetInterface, and causes a crash (or arbitrary
          code execution) when this function attempts to use this reference to call what appears to
          be a PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset (0x00).

CVE-2013-3163,Name: MS13-055 Microsoft Internet Explorer CAnchorElement Use-After-Free,MSF Path:exploit/windows/browser/ms13_055_canchor,Rank: Normal,7/9/2013,Type: exploit,"In IE8 standards mode, it's possible to cause a use-after-free condition by first
        creating an illogical table tree, where a CPhraseElement comes after CTableRow,
        with the final node being a sub table element. When the CPhraseElement's outer
        content is reset by using either outerText or outerHTML through an event handler,
        this triggers a free of its child element (in this case, a CAnchorElement, but
        some other objects apply too), but a reference is still kept in function
        SRunPointer::SpanQualifier. This function will then pass on the invalid reference

        it seems to only affect certain releases of mshtml.dll, ranging from a newly
        installed IE9 (9.0.8112.16446), to 9.00.8112.16502 (July 2013 update). IE8
        requires a different way to trigger the vulnerability, but not currently covered
        by this module.

        The issue is specific to the browser's IE7 document compatibility, which can be
        defined in X-UA-Compatible, and the content editable mode must be enabled. An
        ""onmove"" event handler is also necessary to be able to trigger the bug, and the
        event will be run twice before the crash. The first time is due to the position
        change of the body element, which is also when a MSHTML!CFlatMarkupPointer::`vftable'
        object is created during a ""SelectAll"" command, and this object will be used later
        on for the crash. The second onmove event seems to be triggered by a InsertButton
        (or Insert-whatever) command, which is also responsible for the free of object
        CFlatMarkupPointer during page rendering. The EnsureRecalcNotify() function will
        then still return an invalid reference to CFlatMarkupPointer (stored in EBX), and
        then passes this on to the next functions (GetLineInfo -> QIClassID).  When this
        reference arrives in function QIClassID, an access violation finally occurs when
        the function is trying to call QueryInterface() with the bad reference, and this
        results a crash. Successful control of the freed memory may leverage arbitrary code
        execution under the context of the user.

CVE-2013-3897,Name: MS13-080 Microsoft Internet Explorer CDisplayPointer Use-After-Free,MSF Path:exploit/windows/browser/ms13_080_cdisplaypointer,Rank: Normal,10/8/2013,Type: exploit,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It was originally
        found being exploited in the wild targeting Japanese and Korean IE8 users on Windows XP,
        around the same time frame as CVE-2013-3893, except this was kept out of the public eye by
        multiple research companies and the vendor until the October patch release.

        This issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in CDisplayPointer via the use of a
        ""onpropertychange"" event handler. To set up the appropriate buggy conditions, we first craft
        the DOM tree in a specific order, where a CBlockElement comes after the CTextArea element.
        If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen:
        a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another
        event called ""onselect"". The ""onselect"" event will allow us to set up for the actual event
        handler we want to abuse - the ""onpropertychange"" event. Since the CBlockElement is a child
        of CTextArea, if we do a node swap of CBlockElement in ""onselect"", this will trigger
        ""onpropertychange"".  During ""onpropertychange"" event handling, a free of the CDisplayPointer
        object can be forced by using an ""Unselect"" (other approaches also apply), but a reference
        of this freed memory will still be kept by CDoc::ScrollPointerIntoView, specifically after
        the CDoc::GetLineInfo call, because it is still trying to use that to update
        CDisplayPointer's position. When this invalid reference arrives in QIClassID, a crash
        finally occurs due to accessing the freed memory. By controlling this freed memory, it is
        possible to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.","References: ['CVE-2013-3897', 'OSVDB-98207', 'MSB-MS13-080', 'URL-http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/10/08/ms13-080-addresses-two-vulnerabilities-under-limited-targeted-attacks.aspx', 'URL-http://jsunpack.jeek.org/?report=847afb154a4e876d61f93404842d9a1b93a774fb']"

      stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a
      location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located
      on the runtime program stack.

      When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in
      pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the
      WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends
      a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length
      of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character.

      It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character.
      The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has
      declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The
      function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of
      the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local
      variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the
      saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer.

      To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at
      0x74 which is used as an argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as an id file
      extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret
      instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was corrupted.

        allowing arbitrary code execution, publicly known as ""Sandworm"". Platforms such as Windows
        Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be
        vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms
        running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such
        as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to
        a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function.

        This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to
        set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an
        older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little
        configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target.

        In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component
        (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be
        leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly.
        As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as
        a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file,
        and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will
        download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for
        later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's
        actually the payload, and the second for the INF file.

        The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the
        type and cmd property. In the exploit, ""verb"" media command type is used, and this triggers
        the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, ""-3"" is used as the fake gif file's cmd
        property, and ""3"" is used for the INF. When the cmd is ""-3"", DoVerb will bail. But when ""3""
        is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate
        handler for it, which will end up with C:\Windows\System32\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that
        will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution.","References: ['CVE-2014-4114', 'OSVDB-113140', 'MSB-MS14-060', 'BID-70419', 'URL-http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/10/cve-2014-4114/', 'URL-http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/an-analysis-of-windows-zero-day-vulnerability-cve-2014-4114-aka-sandworm/']"

        Vermillion FTP server. By sending a specially crafted FTP PORT command,
        an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code.

        This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker
        controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately,
        the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy.

        Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q).
        The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the
        source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments
        the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the
        following occurs:

          *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0');

        All other input characters are ignored in this loop.

        As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications
        to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit,
        the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the
        location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen
        since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns.

CVE-2010-2709,Name: HP NNM CGI webappmon.exe OvJavaLocale Buffer Overflow,MSF Path:exploit/windows/http/hp_nnm_webappmon_ovjavalocale,Rank: Great,8/3/2010,Type: exploit,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53.
        By sending a request containing a cookie longer than 5120 bytes, an attacker can overflow
        a stack buffer and execute arbitrary code.

        The vulnerable code is within the OvWwwDebug function. The static-sized stack buffer is
        declared within this function. When the vulnerability is triggered, the stack trace looks
        like the following:

          #0 ...
          #1 sprintf_new(local_stack_buf, fmt, cookie);
          #2 OvWwwDebug(""   HTTP_COOKIE=%s\n"", cookie);

          #4 sub_405ee0(""nnm"", ""webappmon"");

        No validation is done on the cookie argument. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation
        is easily achieved by overwriting the saved return address or SEH frame.

        The original advisory detailed an attack vector using the ""OvJavaLocale"" cookie being
        passed in a request to ""webappmon.exe"". Further research shows that several different
        cookie values, as well as several different CGI applications, can be used.

          length.
        3. pointer to a 32-bit value that is used as a vtable pointer. In MSSQL 2000,
          this value is referenced with a displacement of 0x38. For MSSQL 2005, the
          displacement is 0x10. The address of our buffer is conveniently stored in

          a displacement of 4. This pointer is not used by this exploit.

        a technique where the value contained in ecx becomes the stack. From there,
        return oriented programming is used to normalize the execution state and
        finally execute the payload via a ""jmp esp"". All addresses used were found
        within the sqlservr.exe memory space, yielding very reliable code execution

            https://gist.github.com/worawit/bd04bad3cd231474763b873df081c09a because the trick for exploit is almost the same
        - The exploit use heap of HAL for placing fake struct (address 0xffffffffffd00e00) and shellcode (address 0xffffffffffd01000).
            On Windows 8 and Wndows 2012, the NX bit is set on this memory page. Need to disable it before controlling RIP.
        - The exploit is likely to crash a target when it failed
        - The overflow is happened on nonpaged pool so we need to massage target nonpaged pool.
        - If exploit failed but target does not crash, try increasing 'GroomAllocations' value (at least 5)
        - See the code and comment for exploit detail.
