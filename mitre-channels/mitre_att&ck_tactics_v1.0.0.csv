TA0012,Priority Definition Planning,"Priority definition planning consists of the process of determining the set of Key Intelligence Topics (KIT) or Key Intelligence Questions (KIQ) required for meeting key strategic, operational, or tactical goals. Leadership outlines the priority definition (may be considered a goal) around which the adversary designs target selection and a plan to achieve. An analyst may outline the priority definition when in the course of determining gaps in existing KITs or KIQs."
TA0013,Priority Definition Direction,Priority definition direction consists of the process of collecting and assigning requirements for meeting Key Intelligence Topics (KIT) or Key Intelligence Questions (KIQ) as determined by leadership.
TA0014,Target Selection,Target selection consists of an iterative process in which an adversary determines a target by first beginning at the strategic level and then narrowing down operationally and tactically until a specific target is chosen. A target may be defined as an entity or object that performs a function considered for possible engagement or other action.
TA0015,Technical Information Gathering,"Technical information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical technical elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack. Technical intelligence gathering includes, but is not limited to, understanding the target's network architecture, IP space, network services, email format, and security procedures."
TA0016,People Information Gathering,"People Information Gathering consists of the process of identifying critical personnel elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack. People intelligence gathering focuses on identifying key personnel or individuals with critical accesses in order to best approach a target for attack. It may involve aspects of social engineering, elicitation, mining social media sources, or be thought of as understanding the personnel element of competitive intelligence."
TA0017,Organizational Information Gathering,"Organizational information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical organizational elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack. Similar to competitive intelligence, organizational intelligence gathering focuses on understanding the operational tempo of an organization and gathering a deep understanding of the organization and how it operates, in order to best develop a strategy to target it."
TA0018,Technical Weakness Identification,"Technical weakness identification consists of identifying and analyzing weaknesses and vulnerabilities collected during the intelligence gathering phases to determine best approach based on technical complexity and adversary priorities (e.g., expediency, stealthiness)."
TA0019,People Weakness Identification,People weakness identification consists of identifying and analyzing weaknesses and vulnerabilities from the intelligence gathering phases which can be leveraged to gain access to target or intermediate target persons of interest or social trust relationships.
TA0020,Organizational Weakness Identification,Organizational weakness identification consists of identifying and analyzing weaknesses and vulnerabilities from the intelligence gathering phases which can be leveraged to gain access to target or intermediate target organizations of interest.
TA0021,Adversary OPSEC,"Adversary OPSEC consists of the use of various technologies or 3rd party services to obfuscate, hide, or blend in with accepted network traffic or system behavior. The adversary may use these techniques to evade defenses, reduce attribution, minimize discovery, and/or increase the time and effort required to analyze."
TA0022,Establish & Maintain Infrastructure,"Establishing and maintaining infrastructure consists of building, purchasing, co-opting, and maintaining systems and services used to conduct cyber operations. An adversary will need to establish infrastructure used to communicate with and control assets used throughout the course of their operations."
TA0023,Persona Development,"Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations. This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity."
TA0024,Build Capabilities,"Building capabilities consists of developing and/or acquiring the software, data and techniques used at different phases of an operation. This is the process of identifying development requirements and implementing solutions such as malware, delivery mechanisms, obfuscation/cryptographic protections, and call back and O&M functions."
TA0025,Test Capabilities,Testing capabilities takes place when adversaries may need to test capabilities externally to refine development goals and criteria and to ensure success during an operation. Certain testing may be done after a capability is staged.
TA0026,Stage Capabilities,"Staging capabilities consists of preparing operational environment required to conduct the operation. This includes activities such as deploying software, uploading data, enabling command and control infrastructure."
TA0001,Initial Access,The adversary is trying to get into your network.
TA0002,Execution,The adversary is trying to run malicious code.
TA0003,Persistence,The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold.
TA0004,Privilege Escalation,The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.
TA0005,Defense Evasion,The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.
TA0006,Credential Access,The adversary is trying to steal account names and passwords.
TA0007,Discovery,The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.
TA0008,Lateral Movement,The adversary is trying to move through your environment.
TA0009,Collection,The adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal.
TA0011,Command and Control,The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control them.
TA0010,Exfiltration,The adversary is trying to steal data.
TA0040,Impact,"The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data."
TA0027,Initial Access,The initial access tactic represents the vectors adversaries use to gain an initial foothold onto a mobile device.
TA0028,Persistence,"Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a mobile device that gives an attacker a persistent presence on the device. Attackers often will need to maintain access to mobile devices through interruptions such as device reboots and potentially even factory data resets."
TA0029,Privilege Escalation,Privilege escalation includes techniques that allow an attacker to obtain a higher level of permissions on the mobile device. Attackers may enter the mobile device with very limited privileges and may be required to take advantage of a device weakness to obtain higher privileges necessary to successfully carry out their mission objectives.
TA0030,Defense Evasion,Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as or variations of techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation. Defense evasion may be considered a set of attributes the adversary applies to all other phases of the operation.
TA0031,Credential Access,"Credential access represents techniques that can be used by adversaries to obtain access to or control over passwords, tokens, cryptographic keys, or other values that could be used by an adversary to gain unauthorized access to resources. Credential access allows the adversary to assume the identity of an account, with all of that account's permissions on the system and network, and makes it harder for defenders to detect the adversary. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment."
TA0032,Discovery,"Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the characteristics of the mobile device and potentially other networked systems. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system may provide capabilities that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase."
TA0033,Lateral Movement,"Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool."
TA0034,Impact,"The impact tactic consists of techniques used by the adversary to execute his or her mission objectives but that do not cleanly fit into another category such as Collection. Mission objectives vary based on each adversary's goals, but examples include toll fraud, destruction of device data, or locking the user out of his or her device until a ransom is paid."
TA0035,Collection,"Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate."
TA0036,Exfiltration,Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from the targeted mobile device.
TA0037,Command and Control,"The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network. There are many ways an adversary can establish command and control with various levels of covertness, depending on system configuration and network topology. Due to the wide degree of variation available to the adversary at the network level, only the most common factors were used to describe the differences in command and control. There are still a great many specific techniques within the documented methods, largely due to how easy it is to define new protocols and use existing, legitimate protocols and network services for communication."
TA0038,Network Effects,This category refers to network-based techniques that an adversary may be able to use to fulfill his or her objectives without access to the mobile device itself. These include techniques to intercept or manipulate network traffic to and from the mobile device.
TA0039,Remote Service Effects,"This category refers to techniques involving remote services, such as vendor-provided cloud services (e.g. Google Drive, Google Find My Device, or Apple iCloud), or enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) services that an adversary may be able to use to fulfill his or her objectives without access to the mobile device itself."
